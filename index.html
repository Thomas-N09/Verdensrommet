          <h1>Galaxies</h1>
          <p>
            Galaxies consist of stars, planets, and vast clouds of gas and dust,
            all bound together by gravity. The largest contain trillions of
            stars and can be more than a million light-years across. The
            smallest can contain a few thousand stars and span just a few
            hundred light-years. Most large galaxies have supermassive black
            holes at their centers, some with billions of times the Sun’s
            mass.<br /><br />
          </p>

          <div>
            <img id="smallpictures" src="./images/galaxy2.jpg" alt="galaxy" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and
            ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances, usually
            dubbed irregular.
            <br /><br />
            Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old.
            Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around
            13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy
            formed approximately 500 million years ago.<br /><br />
            Galaxies can organize into groups of about 100 or fewer members held
            together by their mutual gravity. Larger structures, called
            clusters, may contain thousands of galaxies. Groups and clusters can
            be arranged in superclusters, which are not gravitationally bound.
            Superclusters, empty voids, “walls” of galaxies, and other
            large-scale structures make up the cosmic web of matter in the
            universe.

              Our home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It’s a spiral galaxy with
              a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is
              located along one of the galaxy’s spiral arms, about halfway from
              the center. Our solar system takes about 240 million years to
              orbit the Milky Way just once.<br />From our perspective on Earth,
              the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky band of light arcing
              across the entire sky, which is how it got its name. This feature
              marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge on. <br />The
              Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies
              called the Local Group. Its members range in size from dwarf
              galaxies (smaller galaxies with up to a few billion stars) to
              Andromeda, our nearest large galactic neighbor. <br />The Local
              Group sits just off the edge of the Virgo cluster and is part of
              the Laniakea supercluster.

          <span id="marsspan">
            Mars – the fourth planet from the Sun – is a dusty, cold, desert
            world with a very thin atmosphere. This dynamic planet has seasons,
            polar ice caps, extinct volcanoes, canyons and weather.</span

        <p>
          Mars is one of the most explored bodies in our solar system, and it's
          the only planet where we've sent rovers to roam the alien landscape.
          NASA missions have found lots of evidence that Mars was much wetter
          and warmer, with a thicker atmosphere, billions of years ago. Mars was
          named by the Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was
          reminiscent of blood. The Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning
          "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet"
          because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing
          the surface to look red.
        </p>

        <h2>Orbit and Rotation</h2>
        <p>
          As Mars orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 24.6 hours,
          which is very similar to one day on Earth (23.9 hours). Martian days
          are called sols – short for "solar day." A year on Mars lasts 669.6
          sols, which is the same as 687 Earth days. <br /><br />
        </p>

        <div>
          <img id="smallpictures" src="./images/mars.jpg" alt="mars" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane
          of its orbit around the Sun. This is another similarity with Earth,
          which has an axial tilt of 23.4 degrees. Like Earth, Mars has distinct
          seasons, but they last longer than seasons here on Earth since Mars
          takes longer to orbit the Sun (because it's farther away). And while
          here on Earth the seasons are evenly spread over the year, lasting 3
          months (or one quarter of a year), on Mars the seasons vary in length
          because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped orbit around the Sun.
          <br /><br />Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern)
          is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere
          (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 days. Northern
          winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern
          winter is 178 sols.

          Like fellow gas giant Jupiter, Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of
          hydrogen and helium. Saturn is not the only planet to have rings, but
          none are as spectacular or as complex as Saturn's. Saturn also has
          dozens of moons. From the jets of water that spray from Saturn's moon
          Enceladus to the methane lakes on smoggy Titan, the Saturn system is a
          rich source of scientific discovery and still holds many mysteries.<br /><br />
        </p>
        <div>
          <img id="smallpictures" src="./images/saturn2.jpg" alt="saturn" />
        </div>
        <p>
          Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or
          shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn
          apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small
          chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The
          ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks
          as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains. The
          rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud
          tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different
          speed around the planet. <br /><br />Saturn's ring system extends up
          to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the
          vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main
          rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the
          rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap
          measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the Cassini
          Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are A, B, and C.
          Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently discovered.
          <br /><br />Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D
          ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and
          finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the very faint Phoebe
          ring in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe.
